 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Movies and TV Shows data from an OTT platform using Microsoft Excel to identify meaningful trends and insights. The primary objective is to understand content patterns based on content type, release year, genre, runtime, and IMDb ratings. By transforming raw data into structured insights, the project supports data-driven decision-making and demonstrates practical data analysis skills using Excel.

Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information about Movies and TV Shows, including content type, release year, genres, runtime, IMDb scores, and vote counts. Since the dataset was raw and unprocessed, it contained missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent text fields, making data preprocessing a critical step in the project.

 Data Cleaning & Preparation

To ensure data accuracy and reliability, duplicate records were removed. Missing numerical values were handled using average imputation, while categorical text fields such as genres and countries were standardized. These cleaning steps helped create a consistent and structured dataset suitable for analysis and visualization.

 Data Analysis & Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Excel pivot tables and charts. Multiple visualizations were created, including:

Pie charts to compare Movies vs TV Shows and analyze age certifications

Bar charts to study IMDb scores by content type and release year trends

Histograms to understand runtime distribution and skewness

Line charts to analyze content growth and IMDb voting trends over time

Scatter plots to examine the relationship between runtime and IMDb ratings

Boxplots to identify outliers in IMDb score distributions

Outlier Treatment & Statistical Analysis

Outliers were identified using boxplots and analyzed to improve distribution symmetry. Measures of central tendency and spread were evaluated, revealing that TV shows generally achieve higher IMDb ratings, while movies show greater variability in performance.

 Dashboard & Conclusion

An interactive Excel dashboard was created to visually summarize key insights. The project concludes that runtime has minimal impact on IMDb ratings and that TV shows consistently receive higher ratings compared to movies, providing valuable insights for content strategy and decision-making.
